# Xylem Studios Project Status Tracker 3000™

So if you want to know more about what, why, how: then go check out [xylem.studio](https://xylem.studio) which is the new official website.

This page is about what's done, and what's going to be done. Xylem Studios had quite a few projects, and I have quite some things planned to give it a proper good revival.

This will be accomplished in multiple phases.

## Overview

A more detailed explanation can be found later in this document. Here's a quick overview in a neat little table:

Project      | Code pushed | Code cleaned | Rewritten in C++ |
------------ | --------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
ColorUtility | ✔️ ([link](https://github.com/xylemstudios/ColorUtility-vb)) | ⌛ | ❌ |
AnimateGif   | ⌛ | ❌ | ❌ |
HashSlash    | ⌛ | ❌ | ❌ |
PhotoScaler  | ⌛ | ❌ | ❌ |


## ⌛ Step 1 - Upload all the things

Basically give the projects a fresh project structure and upload them in the state that they were last released in, so there's at least source code out there for people to look at if they're curious.

- [ColorUtility](https://github.com/xylemstudios/ColorUtility-vb)
- AnimateGif (to-do)
- HashSlash (to-do)
- PhotoScaler (to-do)

## Step 2 - Clean up the code

The second step is to clean up the actual source code, fix the last few remaining bugs and give the project a final release.

## Step 3 - Rewrite in C++... wait, what?

Yep! So my last objective here is to rewrite these programs in cross-platform C++ and make them native apps. That was my end-goal when I first started programming and now that I have the sufficient knowledge and experience to do so, I feel like these little programs deserve to be given a little treat!

Coming soon to a repository near you (hopefuly).
